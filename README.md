# 📦 JavaScript Mini Projects

This repository contains a collection of mini JavaScript projects I built while learning and practicing core JavaScript concepts. These projects helped me understand the fundamentals of the DOM, functions, events, conditions, loops, and APIs.

- 🧮 **CalculatorProgram** – A basic calculator that performs arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- 🔢 **CounterProgram** – Simple counter with increment, decrement, and reset functionality.
- 🎲 **DiceRollerGame** – Rolls up to six dice and generates random output based on the number of dice entered.
- ⏰ **DigitalClockProgram** – Displays a real-time digital clock using JavaScript.
- 🖼️ **ImageSliderProgram** – A basic image slider for browsing through a set of images.
- ⚡ **PokemonProgram** – Fetches and displays a Pokémon image by name using a public Pokémon API.
- 🎯 **RandomNumberGenerator** – Rolls a dice and generates a random number based on that roll.
